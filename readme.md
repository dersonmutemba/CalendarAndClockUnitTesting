# Unit Testing Demo

**_Learning how to write tests for code_**

## Purpose

This project was designed to test my knowledge of unit testing for C# code. The main purpose is to follow the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD).

## TDD basic sequence (Red, Green, Refactor)

* Write large amount of tests before writing the code. The idea is to try to cover all the different scenarios.
* Run the tests (It is expected that they fail).
* Write code that passes the tests.
* Run the tests.
* Refactor until the code successfully passes all the tests.
